            Butterfly Conservation Society of Sri Lanka (ශ්‍රී ලංකා සමනල සංරක්ෂණ සංසදය) is the first organization
            founded in the country for the conservation of moths and butterflies. Our vision is to protect the
            biodiversity and the balance of natural environment through conservation of butterflies and moths. Our
            mission includes: conduct research and collect data on this faunal group, build inter-relationship between
            scientists and amateurs who study them, create awareness among the general public, assist the government in
            conservation efforts, encourage our own members to study them in depth. <br /><br />

            We value the diversity of people in our organization since we believe that diversity is strength. Our
            members are diverse in profession, age and knowledge, yet we all have in common the endless love for these
            soft-winged beauties. Anybody who has a flair for them are always welcomed by the organization. <br /><br />
